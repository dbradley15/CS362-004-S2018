INSTRUCTIONS


run make all #To compile the dominion code

run make unittestresults.out # to create output file

***********************************************
I commented out the more verbose output file.
Please remove the comment markers in Makefile that would allow dominion.c.gcov output to be 'cat' to the unittestresults.out file
if you would like the verbose version.
